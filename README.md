# Hello!

I'm a frontend developer and [I'm looking for a new job(https://www.linkedin.com/in/anacmartins/)]. This is a personal project I'm still working on to learn Vue. I was a very enthusiastic Google Reader user back in the days, so I have decided build my own RSS Reader.

You can try it here: https://www.mine-reader.com/. Keep in mind this is a work in progress. If you find any bugs or have any feature requests (haha) feel free to drop me a message.
